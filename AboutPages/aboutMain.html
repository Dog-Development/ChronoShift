                <h2>ChronoShift</h2>
                <p>ChronoShift Expeditions Inc. was founded in 1983, and dedicated to invention of time travel. Originally we were called ChronoShift Inc. but following the disappearance of our founder, Matt Collins, in 1997 it was decided that time travel should be known and open to the public not just for use by secret agencies and world governments.</p>

                <h2>Founder</h2>
                <p>ChronoShift was founded by Matt Collins, a leading member of the Comission for Human Advancement. A firm believer in science and the ability of man to accomplish anything through it, he became heavily invested in time travel. His experience working for NASA, <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>, and Lockheed Martin put him in an important position not only as the CEO but as a major asset in research and development. Following an accident in 1997 during a test on an early experimental time machine, Matt Collins has been missing, along with the prototype. Some historical records suggest he may have travelled back to around 200 B.C. and became a ruler of a small nation in Eastern Europe, but this is as of yet unconfirmed.</p>
